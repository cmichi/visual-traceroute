# Project Status?

Some bugs left and I want to resolve the `dig` dependency.
Known issue: Loading bar vanishes after first station.


# How to start the application?

You can either import everything as an Eclipse project, adjust the Build path and do `Run As > Java Applet` or you can use the standalone version:

	tar -xf standalone.tar.gz 
	cd standalone/
	java -Djava.library.path=./library -jar trace.jar


# Maps

The textures are taken from the [http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_set.php?categoryId=2363&p=1](NASA's Blue Marble project). 


# GeoIP

The GeoIP lookup is done using a GeoIP database:
